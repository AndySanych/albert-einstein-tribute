            <strong>1896</strong> - Leaves Germany to avoid military service and
            enrolls at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich to study physics
            and mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1900</strong> - Graduates from the Polytechnic and struggles
            to find a teaching position, taking temporary jobs as a tutor.

            continue his theoretical research.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1905</strong> - Publishes four groundbreaking papers,
            introducing special relativity, explaining the photoelectric effect,
            describing Brownian motion, and establishing E=mc².
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1915</strong> - Develops and publishes the general theory of
            relativity, which redefined our understanding of gravity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1921</strong> - Receives the Nobel Prize in Physics for his
            explanation of the photoelectric effect, which helped pave the way
            for quantum theory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1933</strong> - Flees Nazi Germany due to his Jewish
            heritage and political views, moving to the United States, where he

          <li>
            <strong>1939</strong> - Writes a letter to President Franklin D.
            Roosevelt warning about the possibility of Nazi Germany developing

          <li>
            <strong>1940</strong> - Becomes a U.S. citizen and continues to
